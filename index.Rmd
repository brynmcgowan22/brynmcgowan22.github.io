# Hi, I'm Bryn McGowan.
I'm going into my fourth year at UCSB and I'm majoring in geography. I'm interested in agriculture and conservation.  I wanted to learn about GIS this summer because I feel like the field is expanding and becoming more relevant in geography. I'm at the stage where job opportunities are starting to come up and I feel like having experience in GIS will be a valuable tool moving forward. In this GIS course I learned how to deal with relevant data, for example ongoing COVID-19 cases. In my personal life I enjoy swimming and rock climbing.
